"Memory Match Game"

The objective of the game is to match pairs of cards with the same image on them. The game can have a grid of cards face down, and the player clicks on two cards at a time to reveal what's underneath. If the two cards match, they stay face up and are removed from the game. If they don't match, they are turned face down again. The player must try to remember which cards have been revealed to make matches.
